**Call for Papers**

Prospective authors are invited to submit high-quality full papers representing original results in all areas of video and signal-based surveillance. Submissions and final papers are limited to 6 pages in double-column IEEE format, including figures and references. Accepted papers are published in the conference proceedings that will be also available in the IEEE Xplore digital library.

AVSS addresses underlying theory, methods, systems, and applications of video and signal based surveillance. AVSS invites submissions in areas listed below, especially on cross-disciplinary and game-changing subjects. The list of topics of interest includes, but is not limited to:

SENSOR-CENTRIC PROCESSING:<br/>
Sensors (visible/infrared/3D/mm wave/audio/radio, etc.) | Ground, airborne, satellite based (fixed / mobile /UAV) | Crowdsourcing (cellular/social networks) | Calibration and positioning (GPS, etc.) | Communications and networked sensing | Distributed Camera Networks and Smart Cameras | Participatory Sensing

PROCESSING, DETECTION, TRACKING & RECOGNITION:<br/>
Modelling and feature selection | Detection and estimation (change/motion/anomaly/saliency/pattern) | Data association and (multi) target tracking | Classification and recognition | Multi-modal fusion

VISUALIZATION AND INTERACTION CONCEPTS FOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS<br/>
Compression and summarization | Archival, search and retrieval | Human-computer interfaces | Visualization algorithms | Mobile and distributed interaction

ANALYTICS, SITUATION AWARENESS & DECISION MAKING<br/>
Activity/interaction analysis and monitoring | Intention estimation and situation awareness | Crowdsourcing-based methods | Cognitive dynamic systems and bio-inspired methods

SECURITY & PRIVACY<br/>
Data authenticity | Privacy in surveillance | Forensics | Biometrics (standoff, multi-modal, voice, etc.) | Cybersecurity for surveillance (wireless, network, computer) | Advanced Biometrics at a Distance

SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS<br/>
Hardware and software architectures | Research prototypes | Simulators | Civilian, industrial, and military | Transportation (road, rail, air, maritime) | Performance evaluation

Original contributions in any of the above (or related) areas are being solicited. Prospective authors are invited to submit full-length papers, up to 6 pages long, including results, figures, tables and references by the due date (see below). Detailed submission instructions will be posted on the Paper Submission page in due time. Each submission will be double-blind peer-reviewed by at least two experts.
