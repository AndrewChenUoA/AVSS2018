<b>Spiking Neural Networks, Deep Learning, and Brain-inspired Artificial Intelligence</b><br/>
ABSTRACT. Brain-inspired AI (BI-AI) is the contemporary phase in the AI development that is concerned with the design and implementation of highly intelligent machines that utilise information processing principles from the human brain, along with their applications. Spiking neural networks (SNN) and deep learning algorithms in SNN are brain-inspired techniques that make it possible for a new generation of AI systems to be developed  - the brain-inspired AI (BI-AI).<br/><br/>
This presentation has two parts. The first part covers generic methodological aspects of AI and neural networks, including: Adaptive learning of evolving processes in space and time; Data, Information and Knowledge; The human brain as a deep learning system; Classical methods of ANN; Methods of SNN; Deep learning in brain-inspired SNN architectures; Evolutionary and quantum-inspired optimisation of SNN systems; Neuromorphic development software and hardware platforms for SNN.<br/><br/>
The second part presents specific methods, systems and applications based on deep learning in SNN and BI-AI for various problems and data, including: signal processing; audio/visual data for fast moving object recognition; multisensory predictive modelling of streaming data; cybersecurity. It concludes with discussions about the future of AI. A development software system NeuCube and application systems can be found on: <a href="http://www.kedri.aut.ac.nz/neucube/">http://www.kedri.aut.ac.nz/neucube/</a>.
