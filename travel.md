**Visas**<br/>
All overseas visitors are required to have a valid passport and, with the exception of delegates from visa-free countries (please see below), are required to have the appropriate visa. For information on obtaining a visa, including necessary funds and health requirements,
please visit <a href="http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/stream/visit/visitors/">http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/stream/visit/visitors/</a>.

We suggest that you allow for a minimum of 6 weeks to have your visa processed by Immigration New Zealand or the applicable New Zealand embassy or consulate in your country of residence. If you require a letter of invitation, please contact the organising committee.

**Arriving in New Zealand**<br/>
After collecting your baggage at the airport, proceed to the exiting point where your passenger arrival card will be checked by an officer prior to passing through Customs and the New Zealand quarantine inspection service.

Don't forget to declare any necessary items including food, bones, shells. There are severe penalties for failing to declare articles that are prohibited, restricted or for which you are required to pay duty/sales tax. No fruit is allowed into NZ (along with a list of other items that you will see on the customs declaration form). 

Also, every passenger carrying NZ$10,000 or more in cash and/or foreign currency equivalent must notify a Customs officer.
