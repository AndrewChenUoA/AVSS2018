AVSS focuses on underlying theory, methods, systems, and applications of surveillance and invites submissions in areas listed below, especially cross-disciplinary and game-changing ones. AVSS is the
premier annual international conference in the field of video and signal-based surveillance that brings together experts from academia, industry, and government to advance theories, methods,
systems, and applications related to surveillance. AVSS is sponsored by the IEEE and, in particular, by its two societies, the Signal Processing Society (IVMSP TC) and the IEEE Computer Society (PAMI TC).
There is a main conference as well as multiple associated workshops.
