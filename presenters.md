**Oral Presentation Instructions**

Each oral presentation is allocated 20 minutes: 15 minutes for presentation + 5 minutes for questions and setup. All oral presentation papers will also have the opportunity to display a poster (see instructions below).

We encourage you to use bullet points with as little text as possible, and only show essential math. At the conference, 15 minutes before your session you must:
- Introduce yourself to your session chair in the presentation room
- Upload your slides to the conference computer or test your laptop
- If you use the conference computer, remember to embed (and not link) all videos into the presentation file

**Poster Instructions**

Posters are in A1 size, portrait orientation. Please use sufficiently large fonts for readability.

The board for your poster will be identified by the paper number from the program. Materials to attach your poster to the board will be provided.

Poster papers (i.e. those that do not have an oral presentation) will also have a 60 second spotlight presentation at the beginning of each poster session, accompanied by a single slide. The intention of the spotlight presentation is to draw people's attention to the posters and are not meant to be mini-talks. We ask the authors of each poster to prepare a one slide summary. Note that due to the limited resolution of the projector, your poster will not be legible if displayed on the screen, so we encourage you to prepare one slide using Powerpoint or similar software.
