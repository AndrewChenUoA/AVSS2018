**Workshops**

Workshop I: **Workshop on Smart Sensor Systems**

Organizers:
- Prof. Marilyn Wolf, Georgia Institute of Technology, <a href="mailto:wolf@ece.gatech.edu">wolf@ece.gatech.edu</a>
- Prof. Ricardo Carmona Galan, IMSE-CNM, <a href="mailto:rcarmona@imse-cnm.csic.es">rcarmona@imse-cnm.csic.es</a>

Smart sensor systems that integrate sensing, computation, and memory are the next generation of smart cameras. Traditional smart cameras combine traditional sensors and embedded computing systems-on-chips to perform in-camera analysis. Smart sensor systems may combine analog and digital computation with the sensor, resulting in significantly lower latency computations as well as smaller SWaP (size, weight, and power). The novel architectures presented by smart sensors call for a new round of algorithm/architecture co-design to leverage the capabilities of these systems.
Potential topics include:
- Analog and mixed-signal on-sensor computation.
- Digital on-sensor computation.
- 3D VLSI architectures for smart sensors.
- Computer vision applications (tracking, target identification, etc.) adapted to a chosen smart sensor platform.
- Algorithm-architecture co-design for smart sensor systems.
- Simulation studies of smart sensor systems.
- Applications and use cases for smart sensor systems.
- Distributed networks of smart sensors.

Papers are between 6-8 pages long, and will be reviewed by experts who span a range from computer vision, VLSI systems, and embedded computing.
