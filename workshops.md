**Workshops**

Workshop I: **Workshop on Smart Sensor Systems**

Organizers:
- Prof. Marilyn Wolf, Georgia Institute of Technology, <a href="mailto:wolf@ece.gatech.edu">wolf@ece.gatech.edu</a>
- Prof. Ricardo Carmona Galan, IMSE-CNM, <a href="mailto:rcarmona@imse-cnm.csic.es">rcarmona@imse-cnm.csic.es</a>

Smart sensor systems that integrate sensing, computation, and memory are the next generation of smart cameras. Traditional smart cameras combine traditional sensors and embedded computing systems-on-chips to perform in-camera analysis. Smart sensor systems may combine analog and digital computation with the sensor, resulting in significantly lower latency computations as well as smaller SWaP (size, weight, and power). The novel architectures presented by smart sensors call for a new round of algorithm/architecture co-design to leverage the capabilities of these systems.
Potential topics include:
- Analog and mixed-signal on-sensor computation.
- Digital on-sensor computation.
- 3D VLSI architectures for smart sensors.
- Computer vision applications (tracking, target identification, etc.) adapted to a chosen smart sensor platform.
- Algorithm-architecture co-design for smart sensor systems.
- Simulation studies of smart sensor systems.
- Applications and use cases for smart sensor systems.
- Distributed networks of smart sensors.

Workshop II: **Human Behavior Analysis based on Video Analytics and Deep Learning**

Human behavior recognition (HBR) is a key area in video analysis and machine learning application. Close circuit cameras are now widely used to increase security in many high alert areas such as airport, bus stop and railway station. There are various methods for analyzing human behavior such as sensor based activity recognition, gait analysis based activity recognition. Since video is a low cost and easy to use device for monitoring activities, video based human behavior analysis is widely used. Video analytics have application in patientâ€™s behavior analysis also. Deep learning allows models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn features of data with multiple levels of abstraction. Now-a-days deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network have become popular for human activity recognition. The workshop aims at bringing computer vision and machine learning experts together for presenting their novel ideas in HBR using video processing and deep learning approach.  This will give a platform to researchers from both fields to discuss their original ideas in HBR, solution of existing HBR problems and look for future scope in designing more robust model for human behavior analysis system. 
Scope and topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
- Human behavior analysis
- Human activity recognition
- Human/ Object tracking and classification
- Crowd behavior analysis
- Deep learning techniques application in human activity recognition
- Video analytics for patient behavior analysis
