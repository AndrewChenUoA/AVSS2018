What if an app could guide you to better health, similar to how GPS navigation directs you to your desired destination? Advances in sensors, mobile computing, artificial intelligence, data management, cloud computing, biology, and medicine allow approaching human health from a novel navigational perspective. Current episodic practice of healthcare is based on Measure-Estimate-Guide-Influence (MEGI) cycle that is initiated usually by a sick person. By navigating through health states starting from the current state to desired goal state, it is possible to perpetually guide a person using well established cybernetic principles combined with emerging technology that has demonstrated its success in many other areas. This converts current episodic approaches to so-called healthcare, which really is a sickcare, to a navigation through health state-space to guide and move to desirable states. We discuss this navigational approach and present personal health navigator that will help people accomplish this.
