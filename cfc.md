**Call for Challenges**

The 2018 IEEE Conference on Advanced Video and Signal-based Surveillance (AVSS) is soliciting proposals for scientific challenges. The goal of a challenge is to accelerate the pace of research on a specific academic or industrial problem by fostering collaboration, communication, and understanding via the quantitative comparison of competing methods using standardized datasets.

A challenge should align with the topic of the general theme of AVSS; both new challenge topics and topics that were addressed during previous challenges are welcome. We particularly encourage new challenge topics that could introduce new application fields, or existing application fields that would benefit from focused attention from the research community.  

**Challenge key points**<br/>
The challenge evaluations will be conducted focusing on the key points listed below:

- *A short presentation of the challenge*: Why is the challenge of interest to the conference attendees and to the scientific community? Does the challenge address an appropriate and relevant topic or topics of AVSS? Is the challenge goal reasonably reachable according to the time schedule presented below?
- *The data*: Training and test data, a description of the annotations provided, and a detailed description of the rules relative to the competition and the metrics used to measure performance. The test data must be unpublished and not provided to other people before.
- *The organizing team*: A description of the team that is going to manage the competition and evaluate the results. Diversity in the team of challenge organizers is generally recommended. It is good to include a number of people from different backgrounds with experience in the field. These might include researchers from a number of different academic institutions, as well as from the industry, who have worked on a variety of projects related to the topic of interest.
- *The challenge schedules*: Each challenge would require an ad-hoc release of portion of training set, as well as specific time for the data analysis. Please provide a detailed time schedule considering the one provided below.
- *An ad-hoc site*: The administration of the challenge must include the availability of a site for the datasets download, a resource for clear information and contacts and a way to provide results to the organization teem.
- *Publications*: A high profile overview paper on the results of your challenge is a good way to inform the community about the results of your comparative study. 

Challenges will be allocated a half-day workshop slot at the conference (this may vary depending on the number of challenges and received challenge submissions).

**Important Challenge Dates:**<br/>
- <s>Challenge Proposal Deadline: 1 February 2018</s>
