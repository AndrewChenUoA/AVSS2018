Challenge II: **<a href="https://semanticsbsearch.wordpress.com/">Semantic Person Retrieval in Surveillance Using Soft Biometrics</a>**

In surveillance and security today it is a common goal to locate a subject of interest purely from a semantic description; think an offender description form handed into a law enforcement agency. To date, these tasks are primarily undertaken by operators on the ground either by manually searching a premises or by combing through hours of video footage. As such, the Australian Federal Police identified this area as a significant problem within law enforcement. To date, researchers have focused on person re-identification methodologies to solve this complex problem, however, in circumstances where pre-search subject enrollment images are not available, these techniques fail.

Semantic search is of primary interest as it does not require pre-search subject enrollment and instead searches video footage based on a textually supplied target query. The aim of this challenge is to attempt to solve this problem through two tasks, each of these tasks aims to locate a subject of interest based on a soft biometric signature.
